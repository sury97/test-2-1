<h1>Study in Korea <br>Why study in Korea?

<section>
 
 <p> Hi! My name is Wint and I amm from Myanmar. I am now studying in SeoulTech University in Korea. I want to share the important facts about study in Korea. I hope all of foreign students can study comfortably in Korea.
   </p>

<h2>1. Reasons</h2>
<img src="1.png">
<p>During the last ten years, Korea has become one of the most popular destinations for international students studying in Asia. It is attractive, trendy, and has a lot for a newcomer to indulge in and explore. 

There are also a lot of practical factors that make studying in Korea a great choice: living costs are cheaper than in many other developed countries, the tuition fees are reasonable and affordable. With its economic and political upheaval, modernized Korea is famous for its good quality of education and a high standard of health care. It is a safe and secure country with good travel connections to neighboring countries. Trips to China, Japan, and the rest of Asia on weekends or holidays add more perspective to the experience of living and studying in Korea. </p>

<p>TOPIK is a comprehensive Korean Language test including reading, writing and listening.

There are three levels of the test, and two grades in each level, from Level 1 at the lowest to Level 6, the most advanced level.

<h2>4. Part-time Jobs</h2>

<img src="4.png">

<p>To work part-time in Korea international students on a student visa must apply for a permission for certain extracurricular activity from the immigration service. Students in language courses cannot apply for it until after 6 months of study. Official approval from your school is necessary apply for the work permit.

With a permit students are allowed to work up to 20 hours per week (30 hours per week on postgraduate programs). University students with TOPIK level 3 or above have an easier time finding jobs and they can work without limitation during school holidays.

<h2>5.Scholarships </h2>

<img src="5.png">

·  <p>Scholarships in universities: it is hard to get scholarships for language courses or study abroad semesters in Korea but many universities offer some kind of scholarship opportunities for international students attending their degree programs. These scholarships are usually based on academic performance. For example our partner Konkuk University offer scholarships based on your TOPIK-result on the first semester of their degree programs. You get a 30% tuition fee scholarship if you have achieved TOPIK level 3, and the scholarship increase with 10% for every higher TOPIK level, up to 60% of the tuition fee for TOPIK 6. From the second semester and onwards, they offer scholarships from 20% to 100% of the tuition fee to students with a GPA between 3 and 4 from their previous semester.

· Scholarships from Korean government: for example Global Korea Scholarship (GKS) from the Ministry of Education is the most representative one. There are also other public entities and foundations providing scholarships to certain fields and certain countries of students. To name a few, Scholarship programs from the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Scholarship programs from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs etc.
